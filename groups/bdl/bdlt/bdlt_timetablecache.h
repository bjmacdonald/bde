//@PURPOSE: Provide an efficient cache for read-only `bdlt::Timetable` objects.
//
//@CLASSES:
// bdlt::TimetableCache: cache for read-only timetables loaded on demand
//
//@SEE_ALSO: bdlt_timetable, bdlt_timetableloader
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component defines the `bdlt::TimetableCache` class, a
// cache for read-only `bdlt::Timetable` objects.  The `bdlt::TimetableCache`
// class defines two methods for fetching timetables from the cache: a
// manipulator called `getTimetable` and an accessor called `lookupTimetable`.
// Timetables are identified by name using C-style strings, and both retrieval
// methods return a `bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable>`.
//
// The first time a timetable is requested from the cache using the
// `getTimetable` manipulator, the identified timetable is loaded into the
// cache using the loader that was supplied upon construction of the cache (see
// `bdlt_timetableloader`); a reference to that newly-loaded timetable is then
// returned.  Subsequent requests for the same timetable, using either the
// `getTimetable` or `lookupTimetable` method, are efficiently satisfied by
// returning references to the cached instance.  The `lookupTimetable` accessor
// differs from the `getTimetable` manipulator in that when a request is made
// through the accessor for a timetable that is *not* present in the cache, the
// timetable is not loaded as a side-effect.  In this case, an empty
// `bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable>` is returned instead, which is
// effectively a null pointer.  Note that the timetable-naming convention in
// effect for a given cache is determined by the concrete loader supplied at
// construction of the cache.
//
// Timetables stored in a cache can be explicitly invalidated; the `invalidate`
// method is used to invalidate a single timetable and `invalidateAll`
// invalidates all timetables in the cache.  Invalidated timetables are removed
// from the cache.  However, a timetable that has been invalidated in the cache
// remains valid to all outstanding references to it, obtained via earlier
// calls to the `getTimetable` and `lookupTimetable` methods, until all of
// those references have been destroyed.  Note that a subsequent request, using
// the `getTimetable` manipulator, for a timetable that has been invalidated
// incurs the overhead of once again loading that timetable into the cache.
//
// Timetables can also be invalidated on the basis of a timeout.  To use this
// feature of `bdlt::TimetableCache`, a `bsls::TimeInterval` timeout must be
// supplied at construction.  When a timeout is in effect for a cache, requests
// for a timetable from the cache using the `getTimetable` manipulator may
// incur the reloading of the timetable if the one in the cache has expired
// (i.e., the time interval defined by the timeout value has elapsed since the
// timetable was last loaded).  In the case of the `lookupTimetable` accessor,
// an empty `bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable>` is returned if the
// requested timetable is found to have expired.
//
///Thread Safety
///-------------
// The `bdlt::TimetableCache` class is fully thread-safe (see
// `bsldoc_glossary`) provided that the allocator supplied at construction and
// the default allocator in effect during the lifetime of cache objects are
// both fully thread-safe.
//
///Usage
///-----
// The following example illustrates how to use a `bdlt::TimetableCache`.
//
///Example 1: Using a `bdlt::TimetableCache`
/// - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
// This example shows basic use of a `bdlt::TimetableCache` object.
//
// In this example, we assume a hypothetical timetable loader,
// `MyTimetableLoader`, the details of which are not important other than that
// it supports timetables identified by "ZERO", "ONE", and "TWO".  Furthermore,
// the value of the initial transition code for each of these timetables is
// given by the timetable's name (e.g., if `Z` has the value of the timetable
// identified as "ZERO", then `0 == Z.initialTransitionCode()`).
//
// First, we create a timetable loader, an instance of `MyTimetableLoader`, and
// use it, in turn, to create a cache.  For the purposes of this example, it is
// sufficient to let the cache use the default allocator:
// ```
// MyTimetableLoader    loader;
// bdlt::TimetableCache cache(&loader);
// ```
// Next, we retrieve the timetable `twoA`, identified by "TWO", verify that the
// loading of that timetable into the cache was successful (`twoA.get()` is
// non-null), and verify that 2 is the value of the initial transition code for
// timetable "TWO":
// ```
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> twoA = cache.getTimetable("TWO");
//
// assert(twoA.get());
// assert(2 == twoA->initialTransitionCode());
// ```
// Then, we fetch the timetable identified by "ONE", this time verifying that 1
// is the value of the initial transition code for the "ONE" timetable:
// ```
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> oneA = cache.getTimetable("ONE");
//
// assert(oneA.get());
// assert(1 == oneA->initialTransitionCode());
// ```
// Next, we retrieve the "ONE" timetable again, this time via the
// `lookupTimetable` accessor, and note that the request is satisfied by the
// timetable that is already in the cache:
// ```
// const bdlt::TimetableCache& readonlyCache = cache;
//
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> oneB =
//                                       readonlyCache.lookupTimetable("ONE");
//
// assert(oneA.get() == oneB.get());
// ```
// Then, we invalidate the "TWO" timetable in the cache and immediately fetch
// it again.  The call to `invalidate` removed the "TWO" timetable from the
// cache, so it had to be reloaded into the cache to satisfy the request:
// ```
// int numInvalidated = cache.invalidate("TWO");
// assert(1 == numInvalidated);
//
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> twoB = cache.getTimetable("TWO");
//
// assert(twoB.get() != twoA.get());
// assert(twoB.get());
// assert(2 == twoB->initialTransitionCode());
// ```
// Next, all timetables in the cache are invalidated, then reloaded:
// ```
// numInvalidated = cache.invalidateAll();
// assert(2 == numInvalidated);
//
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> twoC = cache.getTimetable("TWO");
//
// assert(twoC.get() != twoA.get());
// assert(twoC.get() != twoB.get());
// assert(twoC.get());
// assert(2 == twoC->initialTransitionCode());
//
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> oneC = cache.getTimetable("ONE");
//
// assert(oneC.get() != oneA.get());
// assert(oneC.get() != oneB.get());
// assert(oneC.get());
// assert(1 == oneC->initialTransitionCode());
// ```
// Now, verify that references to timetables that were invalidated in the cache
// are still valid for clients that obtained references to them before they
// were made invalid:
// ```
// assert(1 == oneA->initialTransitionCode());
// assert(1 == oneB->initialTransitionCode());
//
// assert(2 == twoA->initialTransitionCode());
// assert(2 == twoB->initialTransitionCode());
// ```
// When `twoA`, `twoB`, `oneA`, and `oneB` go out of scope, the resources used
// by the timetables to which they refer are automatically reclaimed.
//
// Finally, using the `lookupTimetable` accessor, we attempt to retrieve a
// timetable that has not yet been loaded into the cache, but that we *know* to
// be supported by the timetable loader.  Since the `lookupTimetable` accessor
// does not load timetables into the cache as a side-effect, the request fails:
// ```
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> zero =
//                                      readonlyCache.lookupTimetable("ZERO");
//
// assert(!zero.get());
// ```
//
///Example 2: A Timetable Cache with a Timeout
/// - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
// This second example shows the effects on a `bdlt::TimetableCache` object
// that is constructed to have a timeout value.  Note that the following
// snippets of code assume a platform-independent `sleepSeconds` method that
// sleeps for the specified number of seconds.
//
// First, we create a timetable loader and a timetable cache.  The cache is
// constructed to have a timeout of 3 seconds.  Of course, such a short timeout
// is inappropriate for production use, but it is necessary for illustrating
// the effects of a timeout in this example.  As in example 1 (above), we again
// let the cache use the default allocator:
// ```
// MyTimetableLoader           loader;
// bdlt::TimetableCache        cache(&loader, bsls::TimeInterval(3, 0));
// const bdlt::TimetableCache& readonlyCache = cache;
// ```
// Next, we retrieve the timetable identified by "ZERO" from the cache:
// ```
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> zeroA = cache.getTimetable("ZERO");
//
// assert(zeroA.get());
// ```
// Next, we sleep for 2 seconds before retrieving the "ONE" timetable:
// ```
// sleepSeconds(2);
//
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> oneA = cache.getTimetable("ONE");
//
// assert(oneA.get());
// ```
// Next, we sleep for 2 more seconds before attempting to retrieve the "ZERO"
// timetable again, this time using the `lookupTimetable` accessor.  Since the
// cumulative sleep time exceeds the timeout value established for the cache
// when it was constructed, the "ZERO" timetable has expired; hence, it has
// been removed from the cache:
// ```
// sleepSeconds(2);
//
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> zeroB =
//                                      readonlyCache.lookupTimetable("ZERO");
//
// assert(!zeroB.get());
// ```
// Next, we verify that the "ONE" timetable is still available in the cache:
// ```
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> oneB =
//                                       readonlyCache.lookupTimetable("ONE");
//
// assert(oneA.get() == oneB.get());
// ```
// Finally, we sleep for an additional 2 seconds and verify that the "ONE"
// timetable has also expired:
// ```
// sleepSeconds(2);
//
// bsl::shared_ptr<const bdlt::Timetable> oneC =
//                                       readonlyCache.lookupTimetable("ONE");
//
// assert(!oneC.get());
// ```
