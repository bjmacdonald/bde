//@PURPOSE: Provide support for the `bslstl_map.t.cpp` test driver.
//
//@CLASSES:
//
//@SEE_ALSO: bslstl_map
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component provides a second translation unit for `map`
// test cases to reduce the test-driver's build time.  The usage example test,
// and test cases 1-8 are in the original component test driver.  Test cases
// 9-27 are in this subordinate component's test driver.  Test case 28 is in
// the `bslstl_map_test2` component's test driver, while the remaining tests
// (29 and higher) are in the `bslstl_map_test3` component's test driver.
//
// As the number of test concerns grows, and the number of types to instantiate
// `map` with in order to gain complete code coverage grows, we have exceeded
// the limits of certain compilers.  For example, gcc will not produce a valid
// `.o` file as the number of template instantiations exceeds some internal
// tables.  In order to continue providing full coverage, some of the standard
// value-semantic type test cases (1-8) are handled by the primary component
// test driver, and the remaining standard tests, and tests for all remaining
// functionality are moved into three additional component, that comprise only
// a test driver.
