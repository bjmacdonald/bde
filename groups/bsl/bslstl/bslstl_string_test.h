//@PURPOSE: Provide support for the `bslstl_string.t.cpp` test driver.
//
//@CLASSES:
//
//@SEE_ALSO: bslstl_string
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component provides a second translation unit for `string`
// test cases to reduce the test-driver's build time.  Test cases 1-11, plus
// the usage example test, are in the original component test driver, the
// remaining tests (11 and higher) are in this subordinate component's test
// driver.
//
// As the number of test concerns grows, and the number of types to instantiate
// `string` with in order to gain complete code coverage grows, we have
// exceeded the limits of certain compilers.  For example, gcc will not produce
// a valid `.o` file as the number of template instantiations exceeds some
// internal tables.  In order to continue providing full coverage, the standard
// value-semantic type test cases 1-10 are handled by the primary component
// test driver, and the tests for all remaining functionality are moved into
// this component, that comprises only a test driver.
