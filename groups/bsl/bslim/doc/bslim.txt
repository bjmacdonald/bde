@PURPOSE: Provide implementation mechanisms.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library Implementation Mechanisms (bslim)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bslim' package provides implementation mechanisms that are
 typically used to implement functionality provided by other components.  For
 example, 'bslim_printer' greatly simplifies the implementation of standard BDE
 'print' methods having this interface:
..
  bsl::ostream& print(bsl::ostream& stream,
                      int           level          = 0,
                      int           spacesPerLevel = 4) const;
..
 The 'bslim_testutil' component provides a set of macros that are widely used
 in the test drivers of other BDE components.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bslim' package currently has 7 components having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
..
  2. bslim_fuzzutil
     bslim_printer

  1. bslim_bslstandardheadertest
     bslim_formatguard
     bslim_fuzzdataview
     bslim_gtestutil
     bslim_testutil
..

/Component Synopsis
/------------------
: 'bslim_bslstandardheadertest':

:      Provide a guard for saving the state of a stream object.
:
: 'bslim_fuzzdataview':
:      Provide a view of a buffer of fuzz data bytes.
:
: 'bslim_fuzzutil':
:      Provide fuzz test utilities for basic types.
:
: 'bslim_gtestutil':
:      Provide facilities for debugging BDE with gtest.
:
: 'bslim_printer':
:      Provide a mechanism to implement standard `print` methods.
:
: 'bslim_testutil':
:      Provide test utilities for components above `bsl`.
